# Researcher Chatbot
Researcher Chatbot is an innovative web application that simplifies the process of extracting knowledge and insights from PDF documents. Users can upload one or multiple PDFs, ask questions in natural language, and receive highly relevant answers. This system leverages advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and search technologies to provide an efficient and intuitive information retrieval experience.

## Key Features
PDF Text Splitting: Upload PDF documents, and the system parses the content into smaller, digestible chunks for easy analysis.

Semantic Embeddings: Text fragments are transformed into high-dimensional semantic embeddings to capture context and meaning.

Vector Database (FAISS): All embeddings are indexed in a robust vector store powered by FAISS for efficient retrieval.

Natural Language Questions: Ask questions in plain language, and the system generates embeddings for queries.

Top-Ranked Results: Receive top-ranked search results to quickly find the most pertinent information.

Language Model Integration (OpenAI's LLM): Get in-depth answers and contextual comprehension by integrating with OpenAI's Language Model.

User-Friendly Interface: The web application is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## How It Works
Upload your PDF documents.

Ask your questions in natural language.

The system generates semantic embeddings for both documents and queries.

A semantic search is performed to retrieve top-ranked results.

The selected results are seamlessly integrated with OpenAI's Language Model to generate comprehensive answers.

### Researcher Chatbot is a valuable tool for researchers, students, professionals, and anyone seeking to extract knowledge from PDF documents efficiently. By combining advanced document processing, semantic search, and language modeling, this project empowers users to effortlessly access and understand complex information, making it a valuable asset in the quest for knowledge and insights.
